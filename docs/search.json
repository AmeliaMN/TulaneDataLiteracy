    "text": "Searching for data\nIf you have an idea of what you‚Äôre looking for, Google dataset search can be a good place to start. It is a particular version of google that just searches for data. It works much like regular google, so you can search for things with or without quotation marks around them, and limit searches with -. For example, I often find Figshare results less than useful, so I add -site:figshare.com to remove those results.\nIf you have no idea where to start, the Data is Plural newsletter and associated spreadsheet can help spark ideas. I will often use Ctrl+F to search for a word within the spreadsheet, or just scroll through looking for phrases that catch my eye. Newer datasets are at the bottom of the spreadsheet.\nMore places to look:\n\nThe FiveThirtyEight data archive\nData.gov has 186,000+ datasets! (Although, many of them can be hard to work with)\nIRE and NICAR are good resources for the types of data journalists care about. For example, Energy data sources and Chrys Wu‚Äôs resource page.\nTidy Tuesday. Dig into the data directory and the different years. If you scroll down you can select the year when the data was posted, and see a listing of the datasets. There‚Äôs lots of fun stuff here! Animal Crossing, craft beer, Medium articles, and much more.\nIf you are interested in text data, Project Gutenberg has the full text of 70,000 books. There are other sources for text data, like Hathi Trust. But, many people who work with text data access it using APIs or by scraping it from the web (out of scope for this week, but I‚Äôm happy to talk about these techniques!).\nTulane has a number of libguides about data:\n\nStatistics & Data for the Social Sciences\nDemographics, Data & Statistics Library Guide\nHealth Sciences Data and Statistical Portal\nBusiness Databases\n\n\nIf you have data already on your computer somewhere, that‚Äôs fine, as well. ‚ÄúRectangular‚Äù data is usually the simplest to work with‚Äì think anything that could be found in an Excel spreadsheet or csv file. Text data would also work.",

I‚Äôm providing them both as a jumping-off-point for institute ground rules and as inspiration for your syllabus statements.\n\nInclusive classroom\nBecause data is collected by and about humans, it always encodes our viewpoints and biases. As a result, this course will likely touch upon difficult topics related to race, gender, inequality, class, and oppression.\nWe each come into this class with different perspectives that can be shared to enhance our understanding of these issues. I ask that you enter these conversations with respect, curiosity, and cultural humility. You should be open to alternative perspectives and willing to revise beliefs that are based on misinformation. As a general rule, your ideas and experiences can always be shared during these conversation but refrain from dismissing the experiences of others.\nPlease plan to treat me and your classmates with respect. To me, respect includes using peoples‚Äô pronouns and preferred name (both for me and for your classmates), arriving at class on time or coming in quietly if you are late, and focusing on the task at hand. Of course, personal attacks of any kind will not be tolerated.\n\n\nCollaboration and generative AI\nThe goal of this course is to help you develop and strengthen your skills as a data communicator. It is acceptable to work collaboratively with other students, or use generative AI (such as ChatGPT) to help you understand topics, debug code, and clean up written work. However, I expect all work submitted to be substantively yours. This means that copying and pasting large blocks of code or major textual elements from another student, internet websites, or generative AI systems, is not acceptable. If I suspect work you submitted is not substantively yours, I may ask you to come in and discuss the work with me. If you cannot explain how you arrived at the solution, and restate the work in your words, you will receive no credit. All students are bound by the Undergraduate Student Academic Integrity Policy. Cases of dishonesty, plagiarism, etc., will be reported to the dean.",

Express maps can‚Äôt be very data-driven, but they are easy to make. If you have just a few geographic features to show, or you don‚Äôt have a dataset, use this option.\nA full-blown ArcGIS map. To make one of these, you will need to go back to the main ArcGIS website, Tulane ArcGIS online portal and click ‚Äúmap‚Äù at the top of the page. From there, you can add layers to the map by uploading data. For example, you could download the shapefile for the NORDc facilities or murals in Montreal.",

(Check the URLs of those sites‚Äì mostly githubusername.github.io or github.com/githubusername.)\nProject site.

Is it true that movies made today tend to have overlapping genres in a way that they did not in the past? Is is true that older movies tended to fit squarely in one genre, while more recent movies tend to span multiple genres? Is there a historical moment where this genre complexity begins? Does it have patterns of any discernible kind?\n\nSee info_type_id = 3\n\nSequels with SQL: Hollywood seems to be more repetitive than it used to be. Is this true? We now have not only sequels, but also remakes and reboots. Are these follow-up films more common today than they used to be? Can you trace the evolution of sequels across time in Hollywood? Are sequels more frequent today?

Yet the difference between data that are missing at random versus missing systematically is crucial. What movies are present in the IMDB? We know there are box office Hollywood movies, independent films, experimental/avant-garde films, adult films, and foreign films. What films are missing?
